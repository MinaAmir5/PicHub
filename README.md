# PicHub

PicHub is an interactive picture-hosting website where users can upload, like, comment, and delete pictures. This web app is built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, with a MongoDB database to store users and picture-related data.

## Features

### 1. **User Authentication**
- Secure user registration and login system using authentication tokens.
- Users can manage their profile and view uploaded and liked pictures.

### 2. **Picture Upload and Hosting**
- Users can upload pictures, which are stored in the database and displayed in the user’s profile under “Uploads.”
- Seamless and intuitive UI for uploading and viewing pictures.

### 3. **Interactive Liking System**
- Users can like and unlike pictures, with the total number of likes displayed below each picture.
- A separate “Liked Pictures” section for users to view the images they've liked.

### 4. **Commenting on Pictures**
- Users can comment on pictures. A scrollable comment section appears for each image, allowing users to view and add comments.
- Comments are efficiently stored in the database and loaded dynamically when requested.

### 5. **Report and Delete Functionality**
- Pictures can be reported by users. However, reports are hidden from the view, maintaining privacy.
- Users can delete pictures from their own uploads. If a picture is deleted from “Liked Pictures,” it will also decrement the like count.

### 6. **Responsive Design**
- The website is built with responsiveness in mind, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
